 A world clock is a tool that displays the current time in different time zones around the world, making it easier to keep track of time in different regions.
 In this project, we have developed a Java-based world clock that displays the time in different regions based on the location of the mouse pointer on a world map. The 
 application allows users to move the mouse cursor over the map image to highlight a specific location and display the current time in that location. It is based on the 
 World Clock where people can access any country in the world and check it's time from anywhere in the world.


In this project, the APIs used are Swing API & AWT API (for Graphical User Interface) and Date Time JAVA 8 API. Use of Swing API makes this project platform Independent , lightweight and manageable.
